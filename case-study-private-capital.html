                <h1>From Unexplored Data to a Â£2M+ Private Capital BI Product</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 20px; color: var(--text-primary); margin-bottom: 40px;">
                    <strong>The Goal:</strong> To elevate the company's offering from especially providing data to providing workflows and insights with sticky BI data product, boosting client retention and Lifetime Value (LTV).
                </p>

                <h2>What were the challenges?</h2>
                <p>The company already provides useful datasets to private capital players, but how do we get clients to perform more of their workflow within our application? The natural upgrade is a visualisation and insights layer.</p>
                
                <p>I knew there were valuable, hidden datapointsâ€”specifically asset-level operating metrics and granular deal valuation metricsâ€”buried deep within the database of a recently acquired entity.</p>
                
                <p><strong>But where exactly is the data? Does it even exist? Can it be trusted?</strong></p>
                
                <p>The main challenge was the strong lack of infrastructure and documentation. The acquired entity had no data engineers and very limited guidance.  This meant that I, along with a colleague, had to dig deep into the trenches and complete all the work to validate the source data, establish trust, and prove feasibility, all while building a completely new product.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Key Challenges</h3>
                    <p><strong>Business Pain:</strong> Client LTV and retention were stagnant, limiting growth. Clients mainly downloaded data on a few occasions, and then performed their analysis elsewhere.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technical Obstacle:</strong> Data existence, reliability, and source system obscurity. No documentation, no dedicated DE team, and a highly complex legacy SQL Server database.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Key Metric:</strong> Time-to-Market for a minimum viable product. The aggressive target set by Senior Leadership was 2 months to deliver a revenue-generating prototype.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>How did I contribute to address these?</h2>
                <p>The idea came down to <strong>'Transaction Intelligence,'</strong> a Private Capital Benchmarks BI Data Product. To make this work, I handled solely the data pipeline development (SQL Server â†’ Python â†’ Snowflake) and the UI prototyping.</p>
                
                <p style="font-size: 20px; color: var(--primary-color); font-weight: 600;">How do we deliver in 2 months a product that feels like it was developed for many months by an entire product team?</p>

                <h3>The Pipeline</h3>
                <p>I built a robust and trustworthy ETL data pipeline in record time. I had to leverage system thinking and frameworks, along with smart coding and safely use AI to assist. Only using AI would have actually slowed me down as I would not understand the code and would have to spend the whole time debugigng. Only AI when needed. Ensuring the pipeline was resilient and error-free.</p>

                <h3>The Visualization</h3>
                <p>I taught myself everything about Power BI to develop a prototype BI application that does not look like it came from PBi. This involved many intensive design and user workflow iterations with the Managing Director and prospective clients to ensure the final prototype instantly communicated value.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 18px;"><strong>ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaway:</strong> I took on the role of lead backend engineer, lead frontend engineer, lead operational product management and lead designer, while collaborating and synergising with the right people when needed, to meet an impossible deadline.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>What impact was I able to provide?</h2>
                <p>The prototype proved successful enough to warrant native development, demonstrating critical product-market fit and generating immediate revenue. We were able to assess insights on product market fit, very fast, with not much spending and generating revenue on the way</p>

                <div class="stats-grid">
                    <div class="stat-card">
                        <div class="stat-number">Â£2M+</div>
                        <div class="stat-label">New revenue in 6 months (including renewals/upsells)</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="stat-card">
                        <div class="stat-number">30</div>
                        <div class="stat-label">New businesses signed in first month</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="stat-card">
                        <div class="stat-number">50%</div>
                        <div class="stat-label">MoM usage retention (proving workflow value)</div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Tradeoffs & Limitations: Speed vs. Perfection</h2>
                
                <p>Delivering in 2 months required strategic compromises. The codebase was robust and followed best practices, but could have been more enterprise grade. However, these tradeoffs enabled us to:</p>

                <ul style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li>Test product-market fit in weeks and generate Â£500k+ revenue immediately</li>
                    <li>Gain competitive edge by being first to market</li>
                    <li>Validate assumptions before committing to expensive engineering</li>
                    <li>Deploy a workable solution that met all business requirements</li>
                    <li>Use the prototype as a proven blueprint for (self funded) native development and improved user experience</li>
                    <li>More margins, more renewals, more upsells</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Notable clients included <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and <strong>Apollo Capital</strong>.</p>

                <p>The success of the prototype led to the native version development, where I had a critical impact on the backend calculation logic to guarantee the accuracy of all displayed data. That native deployment proved even more successful, thanks to the great collaboration and synergies I fostered with backend/front-end engineers, designers, and product managers.</p>

                <h2>What's next? 'Maximizing the Lemon</h2>
                
                <p>The focus shifts from building to maximize LTV. I now:</p>
                <ul style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li>Further analyse usage of the product to maximize usage retention and client life time value through insights development.</li>
                    <li>Build processes for leveraging this tool for main package renewal or upsell.</li>
                    <li>Improve leads-to-sales conversion, leveraging any data points that can be useful to draw recommendations on how to do so. I'm squeezing the lemon as much as possible.</li>
                </ul>
